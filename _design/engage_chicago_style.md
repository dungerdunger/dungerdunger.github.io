Engage Chicago is a summer field study program run by Northwestern University's Center for Civic Engagement where undergraduates from across the world live, learn, and serve in the Greatest City on the Planet. To drum up excitement or the 2018 session, program coordinators decided to give away free Chicago-style hot dogs on Northwestern's campus. I designed various print advertisements which play on vintage diagrams of ingredients in a classic Chicago-style hot dog.
