Through a combination of academic coursework, field trips, and internship experiences, Chicago Field Studies (CFS) helps Northwestern students explore critical issues in their future fields through the lens of work. I worked with the CFS team to unify various disparate branding elements under a central aesthetic based on the university's global marketing standards. This work culminated in a custom brand guidelines document which clarified the organization's mission, narrative, core attributes, and a variety of visual elements. As a first foray into the new design language, I created a series of print collateral based on the theme "Life After College, in College."
