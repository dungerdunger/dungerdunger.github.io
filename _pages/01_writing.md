I write features, essays, and reviews on technology, energy, the environment, the Midwest and everything else. 

My work has appeared in *The Guardian*, *Undark*, *The Atlantic*, *The Christian Science Monitor*, and other publications. My essay “Fail Again” for *The Point Magazine* was awarded a Pushcart Prize and was a notable essay in Best American Essays.
