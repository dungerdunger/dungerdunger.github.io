My name is David J. Unger, and I work in industrial supply. I also write and design things when I can.

I attended Oberlin College for undergraduate studies, and I received my M.S.J. from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. 

I currently live with my wife and children in Oak Park, IL.
