MY NAME IS DAVID J. UNGER, and I am a writer and designer.

I attended Oberlin College for undergrad, and I received my M.S.J. from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. 

I currently live with my wife [Rachel Kelly Unger](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/editorbio/rkelly.html){:target="_blank"} in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. 

Want to work together or just say "hi"? Email me at [david at dju.me](mailto:david@dju.me)!
